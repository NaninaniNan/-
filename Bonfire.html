<h1>Bonfire</h1>
<strong>Hit me up</strong>
I'll come and get you at the train station
Head down the 405
<u>2 o clock</u>
Drop you off down at you're grand parents
I'll park my car, say hi
<br>Baby tonight, we'll have a good time</br>
Forget all of our troubles
Close our eyes and let go
I don't mind if we get our drinks on
Your mama may not like it
<p>I sure as hell will</P>
And when the sun goes down
We'll meet up by the bonfire baby
<img src="hi.jpg" width=100%">
The moods gon be crazy cause i think i'm in love with you
Gather all of your friends bring a bottle of gin
Make the neighbours go mad just doing what we do
We'll be dancing to songs from the old days,
Swing from the trees,
bend all the rules cause we just love how it feels
By the bonfire baby
The moods gon be crazy cause i think i'm in love with you
<strong>Morning come</strong>
We'll swim away our hangover
And wash our sins away
<span style="font-size:28px">Driving home</span>
I'll let you DJ in my Range Rover
Oh man I love this place
And baby tonight, we'll have a good time
Forget all of our troubles
Close our eyes and let go
I don't mind if we get our drinks on
Your mama may not like it
I sure as hell will
And when the sun goes down
We'll meet up by the bonfire baby
The moods gon be crazy cause i think i'm in love with you
Gather all of your friends bring a bottle of gin
Make the neighbours go mad just doing what we do
We'll be dancing to songs from the old days,
Swing from the trees ,
bend all the rules cause we just love how it feels
By the bonfire baby
The moods gon be crazy cause i think i'm in love with you
Ohhh ohhh ohhh
We'll meet up by the bonfire baby
The moods gon be crazy cause i think i'm in love with you
